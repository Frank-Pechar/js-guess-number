# Guess the Number Game 
## JavaScript Project
## Description of App Functionality, Features, and Methods

Javascript coding project I completed from Udemy - The Complete Javascript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann. This project was originally designed just for the desktop. I created necessary adaptations for mobile devices. I also made numerous other refinements and extensively commented the JavaScript code for educational purposes.
